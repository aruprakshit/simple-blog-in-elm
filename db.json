In the two years before elm/html existed, I am sure someone would have contributed jQuery bindings if it was possible. This has already happened in the typed functional languages that use more traditional interop designs. As far as I know, package flooding is unique to compile-to-JS languages. The pressure is not nearly as high in Python for example, so I think that downside is a product of the unique culture and history of the JavaScript ecosystem.",
